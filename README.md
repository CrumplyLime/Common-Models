# Common-Models
## What is this Repository?
This repository was made for the [Hiddendevs](https://hiddendevs.com "Link to hiddendevs") Application Reader 3D Modeling team, with the sole purpose of finding commonly stolen/plagiarized models in a faster or more efficient manner. 

### How does this Work?
A google form acts as a submittion interface to this repository. Once a form is submitted, the images submitted are placed under a directory labelled as the title given from the form and at the end of the directory's name a unix timestamp is added to prevent duplicates.
